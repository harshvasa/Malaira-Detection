# Malaira-Detection
 Created a Sequential Model, demonstrated whether the image is infected or not from the given dataset, Used adam optimizer algorithm, convo2D & 2D pooling techniques. Using ImageDataGenerator tested random samples to see the output, which after multiple epochs resulted into an accuracy of 94.07% and validation accuracy of 95.29%.

# Data Source
The dataset contains 2 folders - Infected - Uninfected. And a total of 27,558 images. Save humans by detecting and deploying Image Cells that contain Malaria or not! Source: https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria
